# 💻 Project Description


Founded by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia in 2008, Airbnb, Inc., operates as an online marketplace focused on short-term homesteads and experiences. Airbnb, a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast, revolutionised traveling by providing easy, accessible ways to customise itineraries without compromising on quality. As one of the world’s most liveable cities, Sydney is a popular attraction for various Airbnb’s today.

Our dataset deals with 1 year of Airbnb listings in the New South Wales region, from May 2020 to January 2021. Containing details such as the type of listing, its neighbourhood, and also about the host, this is an extensive dataset with over 400K rows. In addition to this, we also have Australia Census Data from 2016 that provides details of the public demographics and their households such as various age groups, education levels, incomes etc. These are categorised based on “LGA” or local government area.

The aim of the assignment is to build data pipelines using the two different input datasets. These datasets will go through all the necessary steps before being ingested into a data warehouse and used in data marts for analytical purposes. Snowflake will be used for processing and analysing the data while Airflow will be used to build the pipelines and GCP to store the datasets.
